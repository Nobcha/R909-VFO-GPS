# R909-VFO-GPS

I would like to study GPS module. I will divert R909-VFO-1602 PCB for the tryal base for GPS corrected VFO.

At first I connected GPS via SoftwareSerial and show the longtituse and latitude on the 1602 LCD. "GPS_TEST20241022_3.ino"
Secondaly I made GPS powered clock. "GPS_watch_kpa.ino"
And I made GPS corrected VFO. "

I adopted E108 GN02D GPS module and connected it to R909-VFO via SoftwareSerial.

I will introduce the sketch of the trial connection with GPS and R909-VFO refered "https://github.com/W3PM/GPS-Si5351-VFO-QEX-JUL-AUG-2015"
