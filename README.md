# R909-VFO-GPS

I would like to study GPS module. I will divert R909-VFO-1602 PCB for the tryal base for GPS corrected VFO.

At first I connected GPS via SoftwareSerial and show the longtituse and latitude on the 1602 LCD.

Secondaly I made GPS powered clock. "https://github.com/Nobcha/R909-VFO-GPS/blob/main/GPS_watch_kpa.ino"

And I made GPS corrected VFO. "https://github.com/Nobcha/R909-VFO-GPS/blob/main/Si5351_GPS-kpa.ino"

I adopted E108 GN02D GPS module and connected it to R909-VFO via SoftwareSerial.

I will introduce the sketch of the trial connection with GPS and R909-VFO refered
